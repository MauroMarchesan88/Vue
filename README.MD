# Vue!

I´m using this repo and it´s commits to document my studies on Vue, while using freecodecamp´s video on youtube (Vue.js Course for Begginers) to try and better understand syntax and Vue´s differences with React.

## History

As with any tutorial, we get a few ways to do things as we keep learning and adding abstraction, im choosing to commit with every new "refactor" and maybe deleting some comments to keep things recorded, log-like, to help me understand how and why we did things as we did.
